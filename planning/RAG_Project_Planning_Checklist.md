## ‚úÖ Preplan Objectives

Before coding a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system, this checklist ensures technical readiness, architecture clarity, and smooth development.

---

## üîß Local Environment Setup

- [x] Set up a FastAPI server
- [x] Configure environment variables in `config.py`
- [X] Connect to a PostgreSQL, SQLite, or MongoDB database (`database.py`)
- [X] Define API routes for retrieval and generation
- [X] Test endpoints using Postman or cURL
- [X] Secure the API with JWT or API keys

---

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Deployment & Scaling

- [X] Write a Dockerfile to containerize the app
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions
- [ ] Deploy the API and vector database


---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Optimizations & Performance

- [X] Profile retrieval and generation performance
- [X] Optimize database queries and vector search
- [X] Implement caching (Redis or Faiss)
- [X] Reduce API latency and improve efficiency

---

## üß† RAG + LLM Integration

- [X] Select an LLM (GPT-4, Claude, Mistral, or LLaMA 2)
- [X] Implement retrieval logic (`retrieval.py`)
- [X] Integrate a vector database (`vector_db.py`)
- [X] Design response generation (`generation.py`)
- [X] Validate results and refine embedding models

---

## üß© Application Assembly & Deployment

- [X] Structure the RAG app under `src/`
- [ ] Set up document ingestion and indexing
- [ ] Connect API, retrieval, vector DB, and LLM components
- [X] Deploy the full system and test with real data
- [ ] Monitor, collect user feedback, and optimize

---

## üì¶ Final Submission

- [ ] Submit this checklist in `.md` or `.txt` format
- [ ] Ensure all sections are implemented and marked `[x]` before submitting
